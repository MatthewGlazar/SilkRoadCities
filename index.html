    <h2>Cities of the Silk Road</h2>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Silk Road was an immense network of trade routes that stretched from eastern Asia to
        western Europe. Despite gaining its name from its role in the exportation of silk from
        China, the Silk Road was important for far more than its function in commerce. The Silk
        Road connected many different cities and cultures and allowed for the transportation of
        people, goods, and ideas across much of Asia, Europe, and northern Africa. Particularly
        interesting are the various cities along the Silk Road and the many exchanges of culture
        that occurred due to these cities’ locations on the trade route, as are the factors that
        led to the decline of each city’s prominence on the Silk Road. Despite being widely used
        long before the Medieval era, this period was one in which trade and cultural exchange
        along the route flourished more than ever before. Each city along the famous trade route
        exemplified intermingling of cultures through its architecture, art, writings, customs,
        archaeological data, and more. While not every city along the Silk Road is displayed on
        this map, those displayed had significant contributions to the flow of goods, people,
        and cultures along the Silk Road. The black marker icons represent the locations of key
        Silk Road cities. Each city name is visible when its icon is hovered over. Additionally,
        cities marked in red have in-depth information available when clicked. Cities marked in
        red, such as Chang’an, Samarkand, and Dunhuang, were chosen for their abundance of
        evidence of cultural exchange, as well as for their abundance of evidence of the factors
        that led to their declines. This evidence is examined in its associated paragraph. The
        in-depth information about each city includes evidence from peer reviewed secondary
        sources, primary sources, and additional articles. These sources detail key elements
        of each city that demonstrate the ways in which two or more cultures left their marks
        on one another. The Silk Road’s role in commerce is only a small part of the route’s
        larger capacity for the exchange of peoples, cultures, and ideas. In examining the rise
        and fall of various regimes, such as the Tang Dynasty, the Umayyad Caliphate, and
        Muslim Karakhanids, one can better understand the potential for cultural exchange in the
        cities of the Silk Road and how this potential changed over time.</p>
