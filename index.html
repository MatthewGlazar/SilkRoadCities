    <h2>Cities of the Silk Road</h2>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Silk Road was an immense network of trade routes that stretched from eastern Asia to western Europe.
        Despite gaining its name from its role in the exportation of silk from China, the Silk Road was important for far more than
        its function in commerce. The Silk Road connected many different cities and cultures and allowed for the transportation of
        people, goods, and ideas across much of Asia, Europe, and northern Africa. I am particularly interested in the various cities
        along the Silk Road and the many exchanges of culture that occurred due to these cities’ locations on the trade route. Despite
        being widely used long before the Medieval era, this period was one in which trade and cultural exchange along the route
        flourished more than ever before. Each city along the famous trade route exemplified intermingling of cultures through its architecture,
        art, writings, customs, archaeological data, and more. While not every city along the Silk Road is displayed on this map, I
        displayed many of the cities that had significant contributions to the flow of goods, people, and cultures along the Silk Road. The black
        marker icons represent the locations of key Silk Road cities. Each city name is visible when its icon is hovered over. Additionally, cities
        marked in red have in-depth information available when clicked. Cities marked in red were chosen for their abundance of evidence of cultural
        exchange, which is examined in its associated paragraph. The in-depth information about each city includes evidence from peer reviewed secondary
        sources, primary sources, and additional articles. These sources detail key elements of each city that demonstrate the ways in which two or more
        cultures left their marks on one another. The Silk Road’s role in commerce is only a small part of the route’s larger capacity for the exchange
        of peoples, cultures, and ideas.</p>
