    Samarkand, historic city of the Sogdians, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited
    cities in central Asia. Samarkand’s position between Persia, China, and Europe made it a
    busy center for Silk Road trade during the Medieval era. As follows its prominence as a
    trading city, Samarkand was also a site of cultural exchange. One way such cultural
    exchange is evident is through the examination of murals painted in the year 660 that
    were found in an Afrasiab site in Samarkand. Written about by Valerie Hansen, these
    murals depict embassies from several different peoples and reflect Samarkand’s political
    situation at the time. The murals depict ambassadors from Turkey, China, Korea, and
    numerous other places. Hansen also notes that “these figures so closely resemble
    contemporary Chinese paintings that they may, in fact, be based on Chinese models, and
    not portraits from life.”<sup>1</sup> These murals show the blending of Samarkand’s custom of
    painted murals in houses with Chinese styles and influence, as well as show direct
    interactions between the Sogdians and various other peoples. Another way that Hansen
    demonstrates transmission of culture in Samarkand is through the examination of local
    graveyards. Hansen notes that a graveyard in Panjikent, just outside Samarkand, had
    “tombs with fully extended bodies, apparently Christian-style burials,” as well as that
    “one corpse wore a cross made from bronze.”<sup>2</sup> This is direct evidence of Christian
    influence on the Sogdians. Historian Peter Frankopan writes about an Iranian librarian
    from around 1400 who recorded advice that “ Anyone thinking of writing, he counsels
    solemnly, should be advised that the best paper for calligraphy is produced in Damascus,
    Baghdad or Samarkand.”<sup>3</sup> This shows that the Medieval world was so interconnected that
    everyday people could not only get the goods they needed, but also that particular cities
    such as Samarkand were associated with premium versions of specific commodities.
    Additionally, Frankopan writes that “Urban centers spurred each other on, with rivalry
    between rulers and elites prompting ever more ambitious architecture and spectacular
    monuments. Libraries, places of worship, churches and observatories of immense scale and
    cultural influence dotted the region, connecting Constantinople to Damascus, Isfahan,
    Samarkand, Kabul and Kashgar.”<sup>4</sup> This is particularly interesting because it shows how
    different cities mimic those around themselves and allows for a direct path of cultural
    dissemination to be traced. However, as Hansen writes, “the political orientation of
    Samarkand—and all of Central Asia—was about to undergo a seismic shift.”<sup>5</sup> She is
    referring to the fact that “by 720 CE Muslim armies had successfully attacked Egypt,
    North Africa, and Spain and had conquered several caravan cities,” including Samarkand.<sup>6</sup>
    The Umayyad Caliphate “took the city for the first time in 671, and in 681 an Arab
    governor was able to spend his first winter in the region.”<sup>7</sup> In the eighth century,
    the Sogdians importance on the Silk Road waned, and thus Samarkand’s capacity for
    cultural transmission also declined, due in large part to the city’s conquering by the
    Umayyad Caliphate.
