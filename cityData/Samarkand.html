    Samarkand, historic city of the Sogdians, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited
    cities in central Asia. Samarkand’s position between Persia, China, and Europe made it
    a busy center for Silk Road trade during the Medieval era. As follows its prominence
    as a trading city, Samarkand was also a cite of cultural exchange. One way such cultural
    exchange is evident is through the examination of murals painted in the year 660 that
    were found in an Afrasiab site in Samarkand. Written about by Valerie Hansen, these
    murals depict embassies from several different peoples and reflect Samarkand’s
    political situation at the time. The murals depict ambassadors from Turkey, China,
    Korea, and numerous other places. Hansen also notes that “these figures so closely
    resemble contemporary Chinese paintings that they may, in fact, be based on Chinese
    models, and not portraits from life.”<sup>1</sup> These murals show the blending of Samarkand’s
    custom of painted murals in houses with Chinese styles and influence, as well as show
    direct interactions between the Sogdians and various other peoples. Another way that
    Hansen demonstrates transmission of culture in Samarkand is through the examination
    of local graveyards. Hansen notes that a graveyard in Panjikent, just outside
    Samarkand, had “tombs with fully extended bodies, apparently Christian-style
    burials,” as well as that “one corpse wore a cross made from bronze.”<sup>2</sup> This is
    direct evidence of Christian influence on the Sogdians.
