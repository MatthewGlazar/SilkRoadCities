    Damascus, the capital of Syria and one of the oldest capitals in the world, was a major cultural center during the Medieval era and was a key city of the Silk Road.
    During the medieval era, the city of Damascus held immense cultural significance as a center of knowledge, trade, and art. It was a melting pot of different cultures
    and religions, which contributed to its diverse and vibrant atmosphere. Damascus was renowned for its skilled craftsmen, who produced exquisite textiles, ceramics,
    metalwork, and other goods. Historian Stewart Gordon writes that “Damascus developed steelmaking to such a high art and in such quantity that traders brought its products
    to all parts of the Asian world.”<sup>1</sup> Damascus’ place as a prominent manufacturing city and its location on the silk road allowed for it to export its goods, and in doing so,
    its culture, to much of the Asian world. Historian Peter Frankopan write about an Iranian librarian from around 1400 that recorded advice that “ Anyone thinking of writing,
    he counsels solemnly, should be advised that the best paper for calligraphy is produced in Damascus, Baghdad or Samarkand.”<sup>2</sup> This shows that the Medieval world was so
    interconnected that everyday people could not only get the goods they needed, but also that particular cities were associated with premium versions of specific commodities.
    Additionally, Frankopan writes that “Urban centers spurred each other on, with rivalry between rulers and elites prompting ever more ambitious architecture and spectacular
    monuments. Libraries, places of worship, churches and observatories of immense scale and cultural influence dotted the region, connecting Constantinople to Damascus, Isfahan,
    Samarkand, Kabul and Kashgar.”<sup>3</sup> This is particularly interesting because it shows how different cities mimic those around themselves and allows for a direct path of cultural
    dissemination to be traced.
