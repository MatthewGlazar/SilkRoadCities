    Of all the cities along the Silk Road, Chang’an is one of the most interesting. Now the modern city of Xi’an and located in the Shaanxi Province of China,
    Chang’an was the location of several imperial capitals for nearly one thousand years of Chinese history. Built in 1384, Its famed belltower represented the
    eastern start of the Silk Road. Due to its place as a prominent Silk Road trading city, Chang’an was a leading hub of many different peoples and cultures,
    thus making it an active site of cultural exchange. Professor Daniel Waugh states the city was “the most populous, cosmopolitan, and civilized city in the world"
    during its height in the 8th century and that it served as a major religious center for Buddhism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism, Nestorianism and Manichaeism<sup>1</sup>.
    Additionally, he references the Great Mosque (Qingzhen Dasi) of Chang’an, allegedly built in 742, as an example of “the syncretism of Chinese and Islamic
    features that we would expect in the most cosmopolitan of cities.”<sup>2</sup> Another example of cultural transmission and exchange is examined by historian Valerie Hansen.
    Hansen discusses recently discovered Sogdian tombs in Chang’an that provide evidence of overland migration of Sogdians into China in the late sixth and early seventh
    centuries. Hansen notes that the tombs are stylistically Chinese, “with a sloping walkway leading to an underground chamber, and often hold a Chinese-language
    epitaph.” She also states that the tombs retain some unique Sogdian characteristics, such as how “In place of Chinese coffins, the Sogdian tombs contain either
    a stone bedlike platform or a miniature stone house.”<sup>3</sup> The blending of the two culture’s burial customs is a great example of the ways in which the Silk Road
    influenced the intermingling of cultures. Hansen also mentions the Hejiacun gold and silver vessels, which were ornate gilt silver cups found in Chang’an.
    Hansen admires the way in which the cups blended the “tradition of Iranian royal art” with “portraits of delicate women in Chinese gowns.”<sup>4</sup> The blending of these
    two distinct art styles is yet another example of cultural transmission between the Sogdians and the Chinese. One of the best examples of cultural exchange found
    in the city of Chang’an is an inscribed Nestorian tablet from the year 781 that chronicles the arrival and dissemination of Christianity to the area. The tablet
    tells the story of how the Nestorian monks arrived, preached their religions, and convinced several emperors to allow Christianity to be practiced. A preface to
    the tablet inscription describes how “in the time of the accomplished Emperor Tai-tsung, the illustrious and magnificent founder of the dynasty, among the enlightened
    and holy men who arrived was the most-virtuous Olopun, from the country of Syria.”<sup>5</sup> The inscription then details how “When the pure, bright Illustrious religion was
    introduced to our tang Dynasty, the Scriptures were translated, and churches built.”<sup>6</sup> This example demonstrates the arrival of Christianity and the ways in which
    Chang’an’s position on the Silk Road helped it to be a hotspot for cultural transmission through religion.
